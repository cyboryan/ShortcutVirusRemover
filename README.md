# Shortcut Virus Remover
Shortcut Virus Remover aims to simplify the retrieval of super-hidden files caused by the Shortcut Virus. It also attempts to remove the virus itself.

This project marks the first application Xyber Pastoril ever created, with very minimal programming knowledge. It was made in 2016 due to a rising shortcut virus issue in Plaridel National High School. It was used momentarily until the school discovered SMADAV that automates the action on device insertion, prompted discontinuation of the project.

This project was recently updated last June 2020 after a few years of inactivity to make code changes, and updated tooltips based on new programming knowledge.
